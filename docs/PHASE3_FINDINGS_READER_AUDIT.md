# Phase 3 — `case_findings` Reader Audit

Goal: make flipping `FINDINGS_PROJECTION_ENABLED=true` provably inert for
every pre-existing surface. Projection rows (`source_module = "projection:<table>"`)
are mirrored copies of specialized-table output, not new analysis.

Single definition: `PROJECTION_LIKE = "projection:%"` in
`src/lib/intelligence/finding-selection.ts`. Every non-projection-aware reader
now applies `.not("source_module", "like", PROJECTION_LIKE)`.

## Inventory — 38 `.from("case_findings")` sites

### Patched (23 reads + 3 gates) — excluded from projection rows

| File | Site | Surface at risk |
| --- | --- | --- |
| casework.functions.ts | priority feed | "acciones prioritarias" list |
| cases.functions.ts | severity tally, critical alerts, case detail list, report snapshot count, chat context | dashboard badges, alerts, chat prompt |
| agents/statistics.server.ts | source_module tally, visible-findings counter | agent stats panel |
| agents/orchestrator.server.ts | entities gate, judge gate, citation sweep | release gates / hallucination flags |
| pipeline.server.ts | total findings metric | run summary counter |
| intelligence/case-state.server.ts | full case state | scoring + chat context |
| intelligence/hallucination.server.ts | verification sweep | false hallucination flags |
| intelligence/document-graph.server.ts | doc↔finding edges | graph density |
| intelligence/canonical-timeline.server.ts | dated findings | timeline duplicates |
| intelligence/report-augment.server.ts | 3 report inputs | report body |
| intelligence/cross-domain.server.ts | module coverage | cross-domain checks |
| intelligence/evidence-map.server.ts | 2 reads | evidence map, citations |
| intelligence/citation-audit.server.ts | citation rows | citation audit score |
| intelligence/findings.server.ts | evidence-ref backfill, `listFindings` | exporter, chat, UI |
| intelligence/litigation.server.ts | 3 reads (incl. attack surface) | strategy panels |

### Intentionally unpatched

- `canonical/writer.server.ts:125` — the canonical gate **must** see projection
  rows; that is the entire point of Phase 2.
- `pipeline.server.ts:578`, `derived-engines.server.ts:47` — already scoped by
  a `source_module` prefix (`engine:discovery%`, `analyzer:%`).
- `procedural-compliance.server.ts`, `findings.server.ts` insert/delete,
  `engine-persistence.server.ts` — write paths scoped to their own module.
- `hallucination.server.ts:122` — update path keyed by ids already filtered.

## Verification

- `tsgo --noEmit`: clean.
- `bunx vitest run`: 376 passed, 3 skipped, 0 failed.
- Chat-cache fake Supabase client extended with `.not()` so the exclusion is
  exercised, not stubbed away.
- No Mexican legal content touched (`mexico-lock.ts`, `case-type-standards.ts`,
  `practice-areas.ts`, `mexico-modules.ts` unchanged).

Flag remains `FINDINGS_PROJECTION_ENABLED=false`. Enabling it is now a
one-line change whose blast radius is limited to `canonical_analysis`.

---

## Phase 3 completion — flag on, consensus live

**Projection enabled.** `isProjectionEnabled()` now defaults to on; the kill
switch is `FINDINGS_PROJECTION_ENABLED=false`, which still makes
`projectCaseFindings` a traced no-op writing zero rows. Blast radius is
limited to `canonical_analysis` by the reader audit above.

**Consensus (`src/lib/canonical/consensus.server.ts`).** The single place that
decides agreement:
- clusters findings by (category, token-similarity of title+description);
- `agreement` = distinct engines behind the cluster — a `projection:*` row
  contributes its producing engine, never an extra vote;
- earns status: `promoted` (>=2 engines + fully grounded citation),
  `verified` (1 engine + grounded), `disputed` (engines split
  critical/high vs low/info), else `candidate`; suppressed/quarantined rows
  can never be promoted;
- `persistFindingStatuses` writes back in one update per status (<=4 round
  trips), non-fatal.

**Ranking.** `findings-rank.server.ts` now weights
importance x confidence x agreement (cap 1.5x at 4+ engines; disputed x0.6).
Findings without consensus data score exactly as before.

**Spanish citation verbs.** `citation-quality.server.ts` previously only
matched English conclusion verbs, so the demotion rule never fired on real
Spanish reports. Added constituye/acredita/viola/vulnera/transgrede/incumple/
demuestra/prueba plenamente/queda acreditado/es responsable/actualiza el tipo
penal, each with a Spanish observational demotion.

Tests: 394 passed, 3 skipped, 0 failed (18 new in
`src/lib/canonical/__tests__/consensus.test.ts`). Typecheck clean. No Mexican
legal-content module touched.

### Addendum — weighted agreement (deterministic vs LLM voices)

`agreement` stayed a flat `engines.size`, so a rule engine confirming an LLM
claim counted the same as a second LLM restating it. Now each voice carries a
weight and clusters also record `agreement_weight`:

| Voice kind | Engines | Weight |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Deterministic stage | `jurisdiction_intel`, `procedural_compliance` | **1.6** |
| LLM engine/agent | everything else | **1.0** |

Reasoning for 1.6: deterministic stages apply codified Mexican procedure to
case data with no model sampling, so their corroboration is independent
evidence rather than a correlated second opinion. 1.6 is set so
deterministic+LLM (2.6 -> 1.32x) beats LLM+LLM (2.0 -> 1.20x), while a lone
deterministic voice (1.6) still cannot outrank a genuine two-voice cluster —
one rule engine is not consensus. Multiplier stays
`min(1.6, 1 + 0.2 * (weight - 1))`; the cap moved 1.5 -> 1.6 so the weighting
is not swallowed at the top end.

Promotion thresholds still use the raw distinct-engine count, so weighting
changes ordering only, never whether a finding is promoted. Findings with no
`agreement_weight` fall back to the raw count and score exactly as before.

Test: `ranks deterministic+LLM above LLM+LLM at the same raw engine count`
(plus a direct `voiceWeight` assertion) in
`src/lib/canonical/__tests__/consensus.test.ts`. Suite: 396 passed, 3 skipped.

### Security

Fixed an unrelated error-level finding surfaced during this turn: the
`audit_log` SELECT policy exposed NULL-`org_id` rows (actor id, IP, user
agent, session) to every authenticated user. It now scopes NULL-org rows to
`actor_id = auth.uid()`, keeps org rows to org members, and allows
`super_admin`.
