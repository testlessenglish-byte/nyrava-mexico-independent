          Nyrava uses a small number of cookies and browser storage entries
          strictly to operate the application. We do not use advertising

          The application stores an authentication token in browser storage so
          you remain signed in between visits. Removing this entry signs you
          out. Additional lightweight preferences (for example the last-used
          case view) may also be stored locally.

          We may collect aggregate, non-identifying usage telemetry to keep
          the service running reliably. We do not sell this data.

      <Section heading="Managing Cookies">

          You can clear browser storage or cookies at any time through your
          browser settings. Clearing them will sign you out of Nyrava.
