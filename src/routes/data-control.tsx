          You control the case data you put into Nyrava. This page summarizes

      <Section heading="Uploaded Documents">
        <p>
          Documents you upload live inside the case you attach them to. You
          can delete individual documents at any time from the case view. When
          a document is deleted, downstream extractions tied to it are
          invalidated on the next pipeline run.
        </p>
      </Section>

      <Section heading="Case Data">
        <p>
          Cases can be deleted from the Cases screen. Deleting a case removes
          the case record and its documents, findings, and analyses from your
          active workspace.
        </p>
      </Section>

      <Section heading="Account Data">
        <p>
          Your profile fields (name, contact information) can be edited from
          the Account screen. To close your account and request deletion of
          all associated data, use the <a href="/contact" className="text-primary hover:underline">Contact</a> page.
        </p>
      </Section>

      <Section heading="Access Permissions">
        <p>
          Data in your workspace is isolated by row-level security. See the
          <a href="/security" className="text-primary hover:underline"> Security Practices</a> page for the
          controls that enforce this isolation.
        </p>
      </Section>

      <Section heading="Provider Keys">
        <p>
          API keys you add in Settings are encrypted at rest and can be
          removed at any time from the API Keys screen.
        </p>
      </Section>

      <Section heading="Retention">
        <p>
          Nyrava does not automatically delete case data. Data persists until
          you delete it or close your account. Contact us if you need a
          custom retention policy for a specific engagement.
