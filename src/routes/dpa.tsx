        This page describes the standard DPA Nyrava offers to customers. Customers requiring a

          For personal data uploaded by a customer to Nyrava, the customer acts as data controller
          and Nyrava acts as data processor. Nyrava processes personal data solely on the customer's
          documented instructions and for the purposes of providing the service.
