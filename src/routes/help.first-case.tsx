          Drag the entire production into the upload panel. Scanned PDFs and photographed exhibits pass
          through OCR automatically. For very large productions, upload in batches — indexing runs
          incrementally.

          Contradiction detection, witness clustering, and timeline reconciliation all benefit from
          seeing the entire record. Curated excerpts reduce the quality of every downstream engine.

          Click Run Pipeline. The intelligence engines execute in sequence: Evidence → Timeline →
          Witness → Constitutional → Strategy → Motion (if requested) → Report. Progress is streamed to
          the Live Pipeline panel.

        <p>
          Open the Evidence, Timeline, Witness, and Constitutional panels. Every finding carries a
          citation you can click to see the source passage. Reject or refine findings that need attorney
          judgment.

          JSON is for downstream tooling.
