// Central finding-classification validation — Phase 1 item #2 of the
// approved "Universal Completed Case Legal Audit Architecture Fix" plan.
// PURE MODULE (no I/O, no AI).
//
// WHY: findings.server.ts trusts whatever proposition_type/speaker_role/
// category an upstream engine attaches to a finding. The judicial-hierarchy
// prompt instructions (finding-taxonomy.ts) already teach the model the
// difference between a party's ARGUMENT and a court's HOLDING, but a prompt
// instruction is not an invariant — an LLM can still emit a structurally
// impossible pairing (e.g. proposition_type "holding" attributed to
// speaker_role "quejoso", which would misrepresent a party's request as a
// judicial ruling). This module makes the invariant a code-level gate: an
// impossible pairing is downgraded to a safe classification, never trusted
// blindly and never silently dropped.
//
// Only `validateFindingClassification` (the speaker_role/proposition_type
// consistency check) is currently wired into the live write path
// (findings.server.ts's addFindings). `validateFindingCategory` (materia
// compatibility) is exported and tested but deliberately NOT wired into the
// live path yet — see the doc comment on that function for why.

 * the case, only under a category that will not corrupt materia-specific
 * report groupings.
 *
 * NOT YET WIRED into the live write path. Every finding's `category` today
 * is a hardcoded value declared once per engine (see the AGENTS array /
 * analyzer bucket definitions in pipeline.server.ts) — no LLM currently
 * self-reports `category`, so this exact failure mode cannot fire yet in
 * production. Wiring this into addFindings would mean re-checking all ~50
 * engine categories against all ~15 materias' allow-lists on every write,
 * which needs its own materia-by-materia regression pass before it can run
 * against active cases (a compatibility-matching gap here would silently
 * rewrite a legitimate category on a real case). Exported and tested now so
 * that gap-closing work — and any future engine that lets the LLM self-
 * report category — has a validator ready to wire in.
