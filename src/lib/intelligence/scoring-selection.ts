// Single source of truth for scoring/report finding selection.
//
// Both the scoring engine and the report generator MUST call
// getCanonicalScoringFindings(). No consumer may apply its own inclusion
// rules. This guarantees score === report across every dimension.
//
// Invariants enforced here:
//   1. Temporal — the upstream pipeline (discovery, contradictions,
//      evidence intelligence) must be finalized before scoring/report can
//      consume findings.
//   2. Structural — `engine:*` AND `agent:*` findings enter the canonical
//      set (both represent finalized, non-provisional pipeline output).
//      `analyzer:*` are provisional and never affect scoring or the report.
//   3. Reconciliation — duplicate/stale children are collapsed before any
//      score or report consumer sees them. The strongest epistemic survivor
//      (for example a VERIFIED_COURT_HOLDING) is the only row allowed to move
//      downstream calculations.
//   4. Safety — an empty canonical set is a hard error, never silent.
//   5. Ordering — scoring must occur AFTER the upstream preconditions.
//
// FIX (2026-07-13): this filter previously accepted ONLY `engine:*`
// findings, silently dropping every `agent:*` finding from scoring and the
// report. That excluded the entire output of the 4 specialized
// investigator agents — chain_of_custody, constitutional_compliance,
// procedural_violations, witness_credibility — from ever reaching the
// Key Findings section or the case scorecard, even when those agents ran
// successfully and produced grounded findings.
//
// FIX (2026-08-18): merely filtering source/status was not enough. The DB can
// legitimately contain multiple finalized rows for the same canonical legal
// issue because different engines/agents produced them before the read-time
// reconciliation pass. Scoring could therefore consume a stale speculative
// child even when report dedupe correctly preferred the verified court
// holding. ADR5829/2025 exposed this: an old "Exención de impuestos" row
// weakened every score dimension while its surviving canonical sibling was a
// neutral VERIFIED_COURT_HOLDING. Selection now performs the SAME pure
// consolidation used by report-time reconciliation before returning rows.
