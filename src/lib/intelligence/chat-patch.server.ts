// Talk-to-Case Finding Patch Set — "Push to Report" architecture fix.
//
// PROBLEM this replaces: the old "Update Report" action packaged the chat
// exchange as a synthetic "case-chat-clarification-*.txt" document and ran
// it through the SAME full-pipeline rerun the Evidence tab uses
// (addEvidenceAndRerun -> queueCaseForPipeline -> drivePipeline -> every
// analyzer/agent re-executes against the whole corpus). The only defense
// against a stale finding reappearing was a prompt instruction telling the
// regenerating analyzers to "reconcile, not duplicate" plus a best-effort
// LLM backstop (case-state-reconciliation.server.ts's
// reconcileSupersededFindings). Neither is a guarantee: the analyzers
// regenerate from the SAME unchanged source corpus every time, so a
// "corrected" finding can come right back.
//
// FIXED ARCHITECTURE: Talk-to-Case reviews the EXISTING findings directly
// against the chat exchange and produces an explicit, individually-grounded
// patch set (keep | amend | remove | merge | create). "Push to Report"
// applies the patches transactionally to case_findings — never deleting a
// row, only marking it superseded with full provenance in
// case_finding_patches — then regenerates ONLY the report from the updated
// findings state. It does NOT touch documents (no permanent evidence
// ingestion), does NOT call queueCaseForPipeline/drivePipeline, and does
// NOT re-run any analyzer/agent/engine stage.
//
// Grounding discipline matches reconcileSupersededFindings and every other
// gate in this codebase: a patch decision is applied ONLY when its quote
// independently re-locates in its cited source text (the chat exchange, or
// an already-attached document) — an unverified claim is dropped, not
// trusted. "Rerun Case" (queueCaseForPipeline, full engines) remains a
// completely separate, untouched code path for when an attorney adds real
// new evidence.

You review an attorney's Talk-to-Case exchange against the EXISTING findings already in this case's record and decide what changes it warrants. This is NOT a new analysis pass — do not re-derive findings from scratch, do not restate findings that the exchange does not actually address. For each EXISTING finding the exchange clearly bears on, decide exactly one action:
- "keep": the exchange doesn't change this finding — do not emit a patch for findings the exchange never addresses at all.
- "amend": the exchange corrects/refines this finding's content but the underlying issue is still real — provide new_title/new_description/new_category/new_severity for the corrected version.
- "remove": the exchange establishes this finding is simply wrong or no longer applicable.
- "merge": the exchange shows two or more existing findings are the same underlying issue — list all their ids in finding_ids and provide the consolidated new_title/new_description.
- "dispute_evidence": the exchange challenges ONE specific document cited by an existing finding, but the finding's underlying issue may still stand (either on its other evidence, or pending review) — do NOT remove or amend the whole finding for this. Set disputed_doc_id to that document's id (it must be a doc_id actually cited by the finding) and dispute_status to "disputed" (the citation is now contested but not resolved), "superseded" (the exchange/attached document establishes a replacement — also set source_document_id to the replacement's id), or "withdrawn" (the citation should no longer be relied on at all). A document can be wrong for ONE finding's proposition while remaining perfectly good evidence elsewhere — this never touches the document's use in any other finding.
You may also propose "create" for a genuinely new finding the exchange establishes that has no existing counterpart — finding_ids must be empty for this action. Do NOT create a finding merely restating something an existing finding already covers.
Every patch (except "keep", which you do not need to emit at all) MUST include a "quote" field: a SINGLE verbatim excerpt copied character-for-character from either the chat exchange text or one of the attached documents (never paraphrased, never from the finding itself) that grounds the decision. If citing an attached document, also set source_document_id to that document's id. A patch without a real, exact quote will be discarded. If the "Nyrava Intelligence" turn in the chat exchange already contains an explicit "Quote:" line, that IS the evidentiary quote — copy it EXACTLY as written there (do not re-type it from memory, do not copy the "Correction:"/"Revised Finding:" text instead, do not shorten or "clean up" its punctuation). Never invent a finding-target from a number like "Finding #2" mentioned in conversation — that is display numbering, not an id; every entry in finding_ids MUST be one of the real ids listed in EXISTING FINDINGS below.
GROUNDING DISCIPLINE FOR CORRECTIONS TO AN "ABSENCE" FINDING: when the finding being corrected states that something was NOT found/identified/argued in the corpus, the corrected claim may only assert what the quote ITSELF literally states happened in this case — never a stronger affirmative conclusion the quote merely makes possible in the abstract. A quote of the applicable legal rule or general doctrine (e.g. what a judge is empowered or permitted to do) does not, by itself, establish that anything was actually argued or done in this case; do not amend "no se identificó una argumentación expresa" into "se identificó una argumentación implícita" (or any similarly stronger claim) unless the quote is a case-specific fact that plainly says so. If the only available quote is rule/doctrine text with no case-specific fact, do not emit a patch for that finding at all.
For "remove"/"amend"/"dispute_evidence" patches only, also classify WHY the original finding was wrong via "error_type": one of unsupported_claim, bad_evidence_link, wrong_evidence_interpretation, duplicate_finding, contradiction_misclassification, wrong_legal_authority, wrong_procedural_rule, wrong_severity, wrong_confidence, missing_finding, false_positive, false_negative, temporal_error, source_classification_error, report_rendering_error, other. Omit it if genuinely unclear — never guess.
Whenever you cite an attached document (source_document_id is set), also classify its purpose in THIS exchange via "source_document_purpose": one of case_evidence (genuinely new case evidence, not a correction), correction_support (supports correcting an existing finding), finding_correction (specifically corrects one finding), report_correction (corrects report-level content), context_only (background, not evidentiary), user_instruction (the attorney's instruction, not a document to cite as evidence), counter_evidence (contradicts an existing finding), duplicate (already in the corpus), irrelevant.
